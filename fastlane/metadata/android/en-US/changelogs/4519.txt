v3.22.0: OpenTracks

Changes:
- Locations are only stored if traveled distance > recording distance interval
  (removed left over functionality from idle/non-idle detection)
- UI can be configured to show a clock
- Idle speed is now configurable

Bugfix:
- Intervals: crash when gain but not loss was stored
- While recording: prevent crash when disabling voice announcements
