v4.7.0: OpenTracks

Changes:
- Statistics: distance, total time, and moving time are included between automatic segments (created due to distance too previous location too long)
- Recorded tracks show sensor statistics again

Bugfix:
- GPX exporter: for automatic segments their might be no location
- CSV exporter: distance didn't use decimal grouping
